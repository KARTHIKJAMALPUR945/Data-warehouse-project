# Data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL server, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics

SQL Data Warehouse Project

üìù Project Description

This project delivers a robust SQL-based data warehouse solution designed to consolidate and transform raw operational data into a centralized analytical repository. The objective is to provide a scalable, maintainable platform that supports business intelligence (BI) reporting, improves data accessibility, and enhances decision-making capabilities.

The warehouse integrates data from multiple sources (e.g., transactional databases, flat files, APIs) and follows a star schema model optimized for analytical queries.

‚öôÔ∏è Data Warehouse Development / Data Engineering

Architecture & Design:
Data Modeling: Implemented star schema with fact and dimension tables.
ETL Pipeline: Designed ETL workflows using SQL 
Data Staging: Used staging tables for raw data ingestion before transformation.
Data Transformation: Applied business logic and cleaning using SQL procedures.
Data Loading: Scheduled incremental and full loads based on source system capabilities.

Tools & Technologies
Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft SQL Server]
ETL Tools: [e.g., dbt, Airflow, Talend]
Version Control: Git

Best Practices Followed
Partitioning and indexing for performance optimization
Surrogate keys in dimension tables
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 1/2 support
Data validation and reconciliation checks
